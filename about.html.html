        <section>
            <h2>1. Formation and Exploration (2006–2014)</h2>
            <p>Early career: working with facade materials, cottages, and small-scale civic architecture. Gained hands-on technical skills and began initial design work, combined with formal architectural education. My academic background includes two specialized degrees — in architecture and construction — which provided both conceptual design training and a deep understanding of building technologies and execution.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Professional Development (2014–2016)</h2>
            <p>Transition to a more structured architectural practice, with growing responsibility in technical documentation, building renovation, and coordination processes. This phase helped solidify core professional skills — working with regulations, detailed design stages, and cross-disciplinary project standards.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. International and Team Experience (2016–2022)</h2>
            <p>Work at the Moscow office of Chapman Taylor, an international architecture firm, on large-scale projects across residential, commercial, and mixed-use sectors. Contributed to design development, team coordination, and BIM processes in projects across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Central Asia. This period marked a step into collaborative international workflows and strengthened my position as a senior architect.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Architectural Concept Development and Visual Practice (2022–Present)</h2>
            <p>In this period, I focused on concept design for residential and office buildings — shaping volumes, façades, and spatial identity. At APEX and UNK, I worked on the planning and design of residential and office buildings — including layouts, massing, façade development, coordination with engineering systems, and integration into the urban context. I also deepened my visual communication skills, developing moodboards, design narratives, and supervising architectural visualizations. This phase sparked a growing interest in the expressive and strategic power of images in architecture — a direction I intend to explore further.</p>
