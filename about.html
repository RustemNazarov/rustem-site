        <h1>Career Path</h1>

        <h2>1. Formation and Exploration (2006–2014)</h2>
        <p>
            Early career: working with facade materials, cottages, and small-scale civic architecture.
            Gained hands-on technical skills and began initial design work, combined with formal architectural education.
            My academic background includes two specialized degrees — in architecture and construction —
            which provided both conceptual design training and a deep understanding of building technologies and execution.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Professional Development (2014–2016)</h2>
        <p>
            Transition to a more structured architectural practice, with growing responsibility in technical documentation,
            building renovation, and coordination processes.
            This phase helped solidify core professional skills — working with regulations, detailed design stages,
            and cross-disciplinary project standards.
        </p>

        <h2>3. International and Team Experience (2016–2022)</h2>
        <p>
            Work at the Moscow office of Chapman Taylor, an international architecture firm, on large-scale projects across
            residential, commercial, and mixed-use sectors.
            Contributed to design development, team coordination, and BIM processes in projects across the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
            and Central Asia. This period marked a step into collaborative international workflows and strengthened
            my position as a senior architect.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Architectural Concept Development and Visual Practice (2022–Present)</h2>
        <p>
            In this period, I focused on concept design for residential and office buildings — shaping volumes, façades,
            and spatial identity. At APEX and UNK, I worked on the planning and design of residential and office buildings —
            including layouts, massing, façade development, coordination with engineering systems, and integration into the urban context.
            I also deepened my visual communication skills, developing moodboards, design narratives,
            and supervising architectural visualizations. This phase sparked a growing interest in the expressive
            and strategic power of images in architecture — a direction I intend to explore further.
